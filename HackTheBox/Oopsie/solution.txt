# getting shell on the box
* regular nmap. 80 and 22 Ubuntu discoverd.
* started gobuster for files and folder (php extention)
* found mail admin@megacorp.com. added megacorp to hosts and started subdomain enumeration with wfuzz.
* started nmap on all ports caus everything else was still running and got a bit stuck
* ran photon and found path /cgi-bin/login! 
* was able to login as guest user.
* looked around. a lot of stuff:
	** upload file (needs "super admin" privileges)
	** account page (uri: /cdn-cgi/login/admin.php?content=accounts&id=2)
	* messing around with this alittle showed we can view data of other users by manipulating the "id" variable:
		Access ID	Name	Email
			2233	guest	guest@megacorp.com
			34322	admin	admin@megacorp.com

			8832	john	john@tafcz.co.uk

	* thought about trying sqli and stuff but then remembered that maybe it will be a good idea to run bruteforce on the login panel first
* saving the login request in burp, I found a nice looking cookies in there - "Cookie: user=2233; role=guest". 2233 is the "Access ID" of guest, so what if we change it to something else...? 
* Changed it to 34322 in CookieManager and BOOM - was able to access the "Uploads" pabel and upload a simple php shell!!!!
* the file of course was saved in /uploads/simple-backdoor.php
# PE
* found user flag in /home/robert/user.txt
* found creds in /var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login/db.php:
	$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost','robert','M3g4C0rpUs3r!','garage');
* searched for SUIDs but didnt find anything usefull (aka didn't look good enough -_-)
* with a bit help from the question, searched for files belonging to "bugtracker" group (robert's group) and found /usr/bin/bugtracker (SUID)
* it seems to look for files in /root/reports. letting it read "../../tmp/hi" worked, and also "root.txt"
* using "1;/bin/bash" did the final trick and I got root shell :)
