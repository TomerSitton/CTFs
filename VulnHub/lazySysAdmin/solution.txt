1. from the nmap we see web, ssh, smb, mysql, and irc

2. trying to play with the irc gave me absolutely nothing

3. running gobuster on the website we find /wordpress folder, and a user named Togie

4. apperently anonymous smb connection is allowed.
   connecting with smbclient to share$ and get the:
   * wp-config.php file. 
   		now we have wp user and password! - Admin:TogieMYSQL12345^^
   * deets.txt file.
   		another password... - 12345


5. connect to the wp-admin page with Admin:TogieMYSQL12345^^
   upload reverse shell as a plugin and.... we have a shell!!

6. sudo with password 12345 and we won :)
